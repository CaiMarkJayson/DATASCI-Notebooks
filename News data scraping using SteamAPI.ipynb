According to Boggs, Apex Legends will run at 720p when docked and 576p in handheld, with a frame-rate of 30FPS in both modes. </p><p>Given that the Switch port will come with cross-play, some players have expressed concerns that Switch players will be at a disadvantage against other platforms (particularly given the game is capped at 60FPS on console and 144FPS on PC, with ways to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/jozyft/apex_on_steam_capped_at_144_fps/\">get around the latter</a>). As detailed in the Famitsu interview there will be an option to disable cross-play, so you can choose whether to pool with other Switch users or give yourself a real challenge against PC and console. Hopefully the Switch-only pool will have plenty of players for matchmaking.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-09-respawn-details-apex-legends-frame-rate-and-resolution-on-switch\">Read more</a></p>',\n",

Thanks to the power of science, this update is bringing a big batch of changes, from new ways to play to the long-awaited launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nThe Chaos Theory Collection Event kicks off March 9th, 2021 and runs until March 23rd, 2021.\\n\\nToday we’ll be telling you about:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch \\n[*] The Caustic Town Takeover\\n[*] The Ring Fury Escalation Takeover \\n[*] The new “Heat Shield” item and accompanying Survival Slot in your inventory\\n[*] A “No Fill” queue option for brave (or is it cocky?) solo Legends\\n[*] The Chaos Theory Collection Event and its associated rewards track, collectible cosmetics, and the new Bangalore heirloom\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd a chaotic blast of balance changes, quality-of-life updates, and bug fixes\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=VZgBbKihSwI;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[h2]NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.\\n\\nSince we’re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.\\n\\nPlus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we’re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game’s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021).\\n\\n[h2]CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER[/h2]\\n\\nWhen life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \\n\\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\\n\\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \\n\\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. \\n\\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\\n\\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\\n\\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\\n\\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\\n\\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. \\n\\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\\n\\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \\n\\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\\n\\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\\n\\nGood luck out there.\\n\\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\\n\\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIn the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\\n\\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\\n\\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\\n\\nHere’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\\n[*] Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\\n\\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\\n\\nIt ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\\n\\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \\n\\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\\n\\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \\n\\nBangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own.\\n\\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \\n\\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \\n\\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\\n\\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\\n\\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\\n\\nOther than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\\n\\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\\n\\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed Low Profile\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate).\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\\n\\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\\n\\nKings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \\n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\\n[/list]\\n\\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\\n\\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon.\\n\\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match.\\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \\n\\nItems will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\\n\\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \\n\\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\\n\\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\\n\\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings.\\n\\nWhen scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes.\\n\\nInspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC.\\n\\n[h2]BUG FIXES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wraith[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall\\n[*] The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps\\n[*] Players are no longer allowed to “glide” along a wall after using the jump pad\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Crypto’s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray\\n[*] Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator\\n[*] Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto’s drone\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World’s Edge’s Sorting Factory\\n[*] Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads\\n[*] When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload\\n[*] Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse’s deathbox\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]3030 Repeater[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[*] 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping\\n[*] \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]MISC[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other\\n[*] Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform\\n[/list]\\n\\nThat’s all for now.

The news comes with the Chaos Theory Collection Event patch, which also brings Apex players a new item, a \\'Survival Slot\\' in their inventory, an LTM, and an anticipated Caustic nerf.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ll start with the biggest news: you\\'re now able to drop into Kings Canyon and Worlds Edge on your lonesome, with no teammates to back you up (or let you down). However, there\\'s a catch, and the monkey\\'s paw has curled, meaning that those choosing to attempt a solo battle royale victory will have to fend off whole teams of opponents. That\\'s right, players who solo queue will be matchmade with full teams in Duos or Trios.</p>\\n<p>Respawn explains that it \"still strongly believes that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay,\" however it is implementing a solo-queue option for players who want to complete objectives, test out the newest character in <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/fuse-abilities\">Apex Legends, Fuse</a>, or take some screenshots for a guide.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/solos-no-fill\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/overtime-comic-release-date\">Apex Legends: Overtime comic series set to release this summer</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/heat-shield-bug-fix\">That horrible noise in your Apex Legends matches should be going away today</a></p>',\n",

Even after developer Respawn extended the event by a week, it\\'s all I can think about and all I want to play. Why? Well that\\'s mostly down to the game\\'s worst shotgun.</p>\\n<p>Locked and Loaded sees players drop into Kings Canyon and Olympus armed with a complete level one set of equipment: helmet, Evo Shield, backpack, and knockdown shield as well as a Mozambique with grey shotgun bolt. Every other piece of level one equipment is also removed from the loot pool.</p>\\n<p>The humble Mozambique - which sits very close to the bottom of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list</a> - becomes your best friend, your trusted confidant, and your saviour. A weapon players would usually avoid at all costs (or ping for a meme) puts everyone on a level playing field from the get-go, and dropping hot now relies less on RNG and what weapons spawn in your building, and more on mechanical skill.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/locked-and-loaded-forever\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/overtime-comic-release-date\">Apex Legends: Overtime comic series set to release this summer</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/heat-shield-bug-fix\">That horrible noise in your Apex Legends matches should be going away today</a></p>',\n",

Respawn\\'s hit FPS game celebrated its second anniversary in style, ending February with 50,000 more concurrent players on Steam than it had at the beginning of the month. It also broke its peak player record over the weekend, with Steam Charts registering <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1172470\">a high of 196,799 players</a> on February 27.

The interdimensional skirmisher has been a top-tier legend since the game released two years ago, but a recent hitbox nerf seems to be putting players off.</p>\\n<p>Wraith\\'s abilities allow her to teleport short distances and create portals for teammates to jump through, which are undoubtedly a powerful tool in the right hands. However, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/season-8-nerfs-buffs\">Respawn increased the size of her hitbox in Season 8</a>, which seems to have impacted her usability. While she retained the Low Profile ability that makes her harder to hit, this seems to be a change too far for many players.</p>\\n<p>While she still looks very strong (and retains her spot at the top of our <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends tier list</a>), being easier to hit can make a big difference in a firefight. Even a slight increase to her hitbox could prove devastating to her usefulness - as Pathfinder mains found out when his was nerfed last year. However, as Wraith\\'s abilities so far remain unchanged, which was not the case for Pathy, we don\\'t expect her fall from grace to be quite as dramatic as the loveable robot\\'s.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/wraith-nerf-season-8\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/tier-list\">Apex Legends Season 8 tier list</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/weapons-tier-list\">Apex Legends weapons tier list: the best guns in the battle royale game</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/apex-legends/solos-no-fill\">Apex Legends is finally getting solos - sort of</a></p>',\n",

       "    'contents': \"[previewyoutube=DPMnd_xKQng;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nWelcome, test subjects. Thanks to the power of science, this update is bringing a big batch of changes, from new ways to play to the long-awaited launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nThe Chaos Theory Collection Event kicks off March 9th, 2021 and runs until March 23rd, 2021.\\n\\nToday we’ll be telling you about:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch \\n[*] The Caustic Town Takeover\\n[*] The Ring Fury Escalation Takeover \\n[*] The new “Heat Shield” item and accompanying Survival Slot in your inventory\\n[*] A “No Fill” queue option for brave (or is it cocky?) solo Legends\\n[*] The Chaos Theory Collection Event and its associated rewards track, collectible cosmetics, and the new Bangalore heirloom\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd a chaotic blast of balance changes, quality-of-life updates, and bug fixes\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=VZgBbKihSwI;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[h2]NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.\\n\\nSince we’re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.\\n\\nPlus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we’re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game’s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021).\\n\\n[h2]CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER[/h2]\\n\\nWhen life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \\n\\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\\n\\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \\n\\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. \\n\\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\\n\\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\\n\\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\\n\\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\\n\\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. \\n\\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\\n\\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \\n\\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\\n\\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\\n\\nGood luck out there.\\n\\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\\n\\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIn the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\\n\\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\\n\\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\\n\\nHere’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\\n[*] Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\\n\\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\\n\\nIt ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\\n\\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \\n\\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\\n\\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \\n\\nBangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own.\\n\\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \\n\\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \\n\\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\\n\\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\\n\\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\\n\\nOther than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\\n\\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\\n\\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed Low Profile\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate).\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\\n\\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\\n\\nKings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \\n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\\n[/list]\\n\\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\\n\\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon.\\n\\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match.\\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \\n\\nItems will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\\n\\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \\n\\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\\n\\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\\n\\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings.\\n\\nWhen scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes.\\n\\nInspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC.\\n\\n[h2]BUG FIXES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wraith[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall\\n[*] The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps\\n[*] Players are no longer allowed to “glide” along a wall after using the jump pad\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Crypto’s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray\\n[*] Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator\\n[*] Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto’s drone\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World’s Edge’s Sorting Factory\\n[*] Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads\\n[*] When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload\\n[*] Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse’s deathbox\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]3030 Repeater[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[*] 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping\\n[*] \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]MISC[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other\\n[*] Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform\\n[/list]\\n\\nThat’s all for now.

Jump in for free rewards, a special Collection Event featuring the return of fan-favorite looks, and the return of Locked and Loaded as a playlist Takeover. \\n\\nRead on more below for details.\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nAs a thank you for dropping with us, we’re loading up the Reward Track with 22 earnable items, including two Event Packs and ten Apex Packs. \\n\\nPlus, during the event, you’ll receive five awards (three matching stat trackers for Bangalore, an Apex Pack, and an event badge) just for logging in for the first time.\\n\\n[b]Locked and Loaded Takeover[/b]\\nAnother Takeover is hitting the normal Play Apex playlist. In “Locked and Loaded”, hit the ground with a full loadout of level 1 gear. You’ll have a Mozambique, White Shotgun Bolt, HCOG Classic Scope, White Evo Shield, White Helmet, White Backpack, White Knockdown Shield, two Syringes, two Shield Cells, and one stack of shotgun ammo. What more could you possibly need, right?\\n\\nAll Common/White level attachments and equipment will also be removed from the loot pool (outside of Common scopes) during the takeover. Drop in and knock ’em out!\\n\\n[b]Seasonal Challenges[/b]\\nTo continue the celebration, we’re giving you some fun challenges to go after with new badges to earn.\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-collection-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Get the “Daily Discovery” Nessie Badge by completing 75 Daily Challenges\\n[*] “Respect your elders” and earn the Mozambique Badge by dealing 102,816 Damage (get the reference?)\\n[*] Earn “Time to Win and Stay Alive” with 8 different Legends to get the Smolfinder Badge\\n[/list]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-mozambique.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nAlso, snag the “Mozambique Here” Weapon Charm by dealing 3,333 Damage with everyone’s favorite weapon to ping, the Mozambique. The Locked and Loaded takeover may help with this one.\\n\\n[b]Anniversary Collection Event[/b]\\nWe’re bringing back 24 fan-favorite items and giving them a fresh look with crimson red and gold touches. If you’ve missed out on a skin you really wanted in the past, now’s the time to snag it, but with a new look that lets others know you were here in the early days of Apex Legends. \\n\\nNormally, unlocking all the items in a Collection Event unlocks a specific heirloom. But you only turn two once, so we’re mixing it up a little bit. Unlocking all items in the Collection Event will earn you 150 heirloom shards, so you can unlock any heirloom you want. And to make it a little bit easier to get there, for this one time only, the crafting cost for all items in the Collection Event has been reduced by 50%. \\n\\nFor collectors looking to get the most bang for your buck, check out our Anniversary event bundles featuring the new content.\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-badges.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOne last minor detail: If you earn Event Packs from the Reward Track after you’ve already unlocked everything in the Collection Event, those packs are still good. They’ll simply grant you 700 Apex Coins (their purchase cost).\\n\\nThat’s all for now. But before we go, we want to say, again, thank you. The last two years has been incredible, and it’s all thanks to the community that has formed around this game. Here’s to two years, and to the future—the best is yet to come!\\n\\nSee you in the Arena.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'contents': \"Hey everyone, I’m Chad Grenier, the game director of Apex Legends. \\n\\nI’ve been at Respawn since the studio’s formation in 2010 and have had the privilege to work on many great games, including Apex Legends from the very beginning. \\n\\nIn just a few days we will be celebrating our two year anniversary so we’ve been doing some reflecting and reminiscing on how we’ve gotten to where we are today. I’d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story.\\n\\n\\n[b]ORIGIN STORY & LAUNCH[/b]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-origin-story.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\n\\nAfter shipping Titanfall 2 we were hard at work on post-release Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another game. Apex Legends wasn’t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game.\\n\\nAlmost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called ‘Survival’ where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]Early ‘survival’ game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together[/i]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\nOur prototype map called ‘real big map’ was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely\\n\\nFast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\\\\\n[i]The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones[/i]\\n\\nThe gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn’t stop playing!\\n\\nThere was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of ‘Friday Night Fights’ playtest winners[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe name of the game turned from “Survival” to “Apex Predator”. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system.\\n\\n\\nIt became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called “Apex Legends” and would never look back.\\n\\nOf course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn’t mean the world will love what you’ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. \\n\\nKnowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it.\\n\\nA few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn’t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement!\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch.\\n\\nI remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team “Don’t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!”\\n\\nAs the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games!\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nEight hours later while we’re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap!\\n\\nThree days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players.\\n\\n[b]TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE[/b]\\n\\nSince launch we’ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We’ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game.\\n\\nThe game continues to grow. Next month, we’ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we’ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWe’ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it’s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game.\\n\\nFor us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It’s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It’s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity.\\n\\nWe’ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We’ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives.\\n\\nIt’s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. \\n\\nThank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come.\\n\\n– Chad\\n\",\n",

       "    'contents': 'The latest season of Apex Legends introduces our most explosive Legend yet, a hard-hitting new gun, a world-shattering update to Kings Canyon, and a whole new batch of quality-of-life updates.\\n\\nSeason 8: Mayhem brings the boom starting February 2nd at 10am PT.\\n\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n\\n\\n[b]DEVSTREAM[/b]\\nJoin the designers as they break down the most explosive updates coming in Season 8.\\n[previewyoutube=BeeCa18YK9M;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n[b]MEET FUSE[/b]\\n[previewyoutube=OAWsJ-m1dV0;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nMeet Fuse: a mercenary-turned-cage fighter who never turns down a good dust-up. His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it’s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses “Wally” to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames.\\n\\n[b]Passive - Grenadier[/b]\\n\\nStack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately.\\n\\n[b]Tactical - Knuckle Cluster[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. \\n\\n[b]Ultimate - The Motherlode[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=Z-xDoDSDM2Y;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[b]NEW WEAPON: 30-30 REPEATER[/b]\\nThis heavy ammo lever-action repeater boasts hard-hitting rounds that’ll nail a fleeing Mirage at 200 paces.\\n\\nThe 30-30 is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the Apex Games.\\n\\nDISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER\\nThe 30-30 Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can’t quite capture.\\n\\nTo further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the 30-30 Repeater has a built-in charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short build-up.\\n\\nThe 30-30 reloads one round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won’t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff.\\n\\nThe 30-30’s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with.\\n\\n\\n[b]KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE[/b]\\nSeason 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper’s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-8-map-updates]here.\\n\\n[/url]\\n\\n\\n[b]LEGENDARY MAGAZINES[/b]\\nSeason 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons.\\n\\n\\n[b]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/b]\\nDamage counter\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] We have now added a damage counter to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we’re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges!\\n[*] Pinging Ammo\\n[*] Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with \"player wants ammo\" in quick chat.\\n[*] Color Blind update\\n[*] Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled\\n[*] Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins\\n[*] Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character\\'s backstory, we\\'ve added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend\\'s life.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]LEGEND META[/b]\\nWraith: Hitbox adjustments.\\nDev Note:\\nWe know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith.\\n\\nWraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we’re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas.\\n\\n\\nEven with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future.\\n\\n[b]Rampart:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Sheila angle increase from 120° to 180°\\n[*] Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through)\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nRampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We’re keeping a careful eye on this one.\\n\\n[b]Horizon:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears.\\n[/list]\\nDev Note:\\nHorizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect.\\n\\n[b]Octane:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane’s “super-jump” that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump).\\n[*] From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they’ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Crypto:[/b]\\n\\nRemove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones.\\n\\n\\n[b]Loba:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Caustic:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic’s team is eliminated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Mirage:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Mirage decoys create footstep sounds.\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nThis change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won’t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.\\n\\n[b]WEAPON META[/b]\\n\\n\\n[b]Fully Kitted Rotation[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\\n[*] Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Attachments[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool \\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Hop Ups[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool\\n[*] The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Volt[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Alternator[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Spitfire[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19\\n[*] Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2\\n[*] Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]EVA 8[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]BUG FIXES[/b]\\n\\n[b]Caustic[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic’s highlight vision.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Loba[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Rampart[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Jumpads in Octane’s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them.\\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart\\'s passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]\\nHavoc[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart’s Amped Cover.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon’s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Clubs[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match\\n[*] Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message\\n[*] Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]MISC[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder’s Town takeover.\\n[*] Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop.\\n[*] Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus.\\n[/list]\\n\\n',\n",

Thanks to the power of science, this update is bringing a big batch of changes, from new ways to play to the long-awaited launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nThe Chaos Theory Collection Event kicks off March 9th, 2021 and runs until March 23rd, 2021.\\n\\nToday we’ll be telling you about:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch \\n[*] The Caustic Town Takeover\\n[*] The Ring Fury Escalation Takeover \\n[*] The new “Heat Shield” item and accompanying Survival Slot in your inventory\\n[*] A “No Fill” queue option for brave (or is it cocky?) solo Legends\\n[*] The Chaos Theory Collection Event and its associated rewards track, collectible cosmetics, and the new Bangalore heirloom\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd a chaotic blast of balance changes, quality-of-life updates, and bug fixes\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=VZgBbKihSwI;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[h2]NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.\\n\\nSince we’re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.\\n\\nPlus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we’re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game’s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021).\\n\\n[h2]CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER[/h2]\\n\\nWhen life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \\n\\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\\n\\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \\n\\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. \\n\\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\\n\\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\\n\\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\\n\\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\\n\\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. \\n\\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\\n\\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \\n\\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\\n\\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\\n\\nGood luck out there.\\n\\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\\n\\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIn the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\\n\\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\\n\\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\\n\\nHere’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\\n[*] Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\\n\\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\\n\\nIt ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\\n\\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \\n\\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\\n\\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \\n\\nBangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own.\\n\\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \\n\\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \\n\\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\\n\\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\\n\\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\\n\\nOther than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\\n\\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\\n\\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed Low Profile\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate).\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\\n\\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\\n\\nKings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \\n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\\n[/list]\\n\\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\\n\\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon.\\n\\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match.\\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \\n\\nItems will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\\n\\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \\n\\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\\n\\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\\n\\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings.\\n\\nWhen scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes.\\n\\nInspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC.\\n\\n[h2]BUG FIXES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wraith[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall\\n[*] The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps\\n[*] Players are no longer allowed to “glide” along a wall after using the jump pad\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Crypto’s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray\\n[*] Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator\\n[*] Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto’s drone\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World’s Edge’s Sorting Factory\\n[*] Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads\\n[*] When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload\\n[*] Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse’s deathbox\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]3030 Repeater[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[*] 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping\\n[*] \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]MISC[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other\\n[*] Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform\\n[/list]\\n\\nThat’s all for now.

I’d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story.\\n\\n\\n[b]ORIGIN STORY & LAUNCH[/b]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-origin-story.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\n\\nAfter shipping Titanfall 2 we were hard at work on post-release Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another game. Apex Legends wasn’t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game.\\n\\nAlmost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called ‘Survival’ where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]Early ‘survival’ game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together[/i]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\nOur prototype map called ‘real big map’ was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely\\n\\nFast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\\\\\n[i]The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones[/i]\\n\\nThe gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn’t stop playing!\\n\\nThere was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of ‘Friday Night Fights’ playtest winners[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe name of the game turned from “Survival” to “Apex Predator”. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system.\\n\\n\\nIt became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called “Apex Legends” and would never look back.\\n\\nOf course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn’t mean the world will love what you’ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. \\n\\nKnowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it.\\n\\nA few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn’t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement!\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch.\\n\\nI remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team “Don’t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!”\\n\\nAs the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games!\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nEight hours later while we’re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap!\\n\\nThree days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players.\\n\\n[b]TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE[/b]\\n\\nSince launch we’ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We’ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game.\\n\\nThe game continues to grow. Next month, we’ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we’ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWe’ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it’s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game.\\n\\nFor us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It’s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It’s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity.\\n\\nWe’ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We’ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives.\\n\\nIt’s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. \\n\\nThank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come.\\n\\n– Chad\\n\", 'feedlabel': 'Community Announcements', 'date': 1612478793, 'feedname': 'steam_community_announcements', 'feed_type': 1, 'appid': 1172470}, {'gid': '4051520269926425061', 'title': 'Apex Legends Anniversary Collection Event Trailer', 'url': 'https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4051520269926425061', 'is_external_url': True, 'author': 'Electronic Arts', 'contents': '[previewyoutube=rjIMSRMtVfw;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nCan you believe it’s been two years?

His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it’s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses “Wally” to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames.\\n\\n[b]Passive - Grenadier[/b]\\n\\nStack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately.\\n\\n[b]Tactical - Knuckle Cluster[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. \\n\\n[b]Ultimate - The Motherlode[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=Z-xDoDSDM2Y;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[b]NEW WEAPON: 30-30 REPEATER[/b]\\nThis heavy ammo lever-action repeater boasts hard-hitting rounds that’ll nail a fleeing Mirage at 200 paces.\\n\\nThe 30-30 is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the Apex Games.\\n\\nDISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER\\nThe 30-30 Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can’t quite capture.\\n\\nTo further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the 30-30 Repeater has a built-in charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short build-up.\\n\\nThe 30-30 reloads one round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won’t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff.\\n\\nThe 30-30’s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with.\\n\\n\\n[b]KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE[/b]\\nSeason 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper’s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-8-map-updates]here.\\n\\n[/url]\\n\\n\\n[b]LEGENDARY MAGAZINES[/b]\\nSeason 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons.\\n\\n\\n[b]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/b]\\nDamage counter\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] We have now added a damage counter to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we’re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges!\\n[*] Pinging Ammo\\n[*] Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with \"player wants ammo\" in quick chat.\\n[*] Color Blind update\\n[*] Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled\\n[*] Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins\\n[*] Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character\\'s backstory, we\\'ve added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend\\'s life.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]LEGEND META[/b]\\nWraith: Hitbox adjustments.\\nDev Note:\\nWe know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith.\\n\\nWraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we’re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas.\\n\\n\\nEven with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future.\\n\\n[b]Rampart:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Sheila angle increase from 120° to 180°\\n[*] Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through)\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nRampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We’re keeping a careful eye on this one.\\n\\n[b]Horizon:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears.\\n[/list]\\nDev Note:\\nHorizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect.\\n\\n[b]Octane:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane’s “super-jump” that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump).\\n[*] From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they’ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Crypto:[/b]\\n\\nRemove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones.\\n\\n\\n[b]Loba:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Caustic:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic’s team is eliminated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Mirage:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Mirage decoys create footstep sounds.\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nThis change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won’t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.\\n\\n[b]WEAPON META[/b]\\n\\n\\n[b]Fully Kitted Rotation[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\\n[*] Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Attachments[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool \\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Hop Ups[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool\\n[*] The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Volt[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Alternator[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Spitfire[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19\\n[*] Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2\\n[*] Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]EVA 8[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]BUG FIXES[/b]\\n\\n[b]Caustic[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic’s highlight vision.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Loba[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Rampart[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Jumpads in Octane’s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them.\\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart\\'s passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]\\nHavoc[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart’s Amped Cover.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon’s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Clubs[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match\\n[*] Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message\\n[*] Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]MISC[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder’s Town takeover.\\n[*] Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop.\\n[*] Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus.\\n[/list]\\n\\n', 'feedlabel': 'Community Announcements', 'date': 1612205754, 'feedname': 'steam_community_announcements', 'feed_type': 1, 'appid': 1172470, 'tags': ['patchnotes']}, {'gid': '4050393736353555998', 'title': 'Apex Legends Season 8 – Mayhem Battle Pass Trailer', 'url': 'https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4050393736353555998', 'is_external_url': True, 'author': 'Electronic Arts', 'contents': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprRC9PNMNU', 'feedlabel': 'Community Announcements', 'date': 1612204496, 'feedname': 'steam_community_announcements', 'feed_type': 1, 'appid': 1172470, 'tags': ['mod_reviewed', 'ModAct_848946987_1612204775_0']}, {'gid': '4050393736342744544', 'title': 'ALGS Winter Circuit #1', 'url': 'https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/4050393736342744544', 'is_external_url': True, 'author': 'Electronic Arts', 'contents': 'The Winter Circuit is coming!

       "  'contents': \"[previewyoutube=DPMnd_xKQng;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nWelcome, test subjects. Thanks to the power of science, this update is bringing a big batch of changes, from new ways to play to the long-awaited launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nThe Chaos Theory Collection Event kicks off March 9th, 2021 and runs until March 23rd, 2021.\\n\\nToday we’ll be telling you about:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The launch of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch \\n[*] The Caustic Town Takeover\\n[*] The Ring Fury Escalation Takeover \\n[*] The new “Heat Shield” item and accompanying Survival Slot in your inventory\\n[*] A “No Fill” queue option for brave (or is it cocky?) solo Legends\\n[*] The Chaos Theory Collection Event and its associated rewards track, collectible cosmetics, and the new Bangalore heirloom\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd a chaotic blast of balance changes, quality-of-life updates, and bug fixes\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=VZgBbKihSwI;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[h2]NINTENDO SWITCH LAUNCH[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Apex Legends is launching on Switch with support for cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.\\n\\nSince we’re launching a few weeks after the start of Season 8, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their Season 8 Battle Pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.\\n\\nPlus, to celebrate Switch players and welcome them to the arena, we’re also launching a Legendary Pathfinder skin (called P.A.T.H.) as a free reward for players who boot up Apex Legends on Switch between the game’s launch and the end of Season 8 - Mayhem (May 4th, 2021).\\n\\n[h2]CAUSTIC TOWN TAKEOVER[/h2]\\n\\nWhen life gives you lemons, you can count on Caustic to turn it into toxic lemonade. Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \\n\\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\\n\\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \\n\\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. \\n\\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\\n\\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\\n\\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\\n\\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\\n\\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. \\n\\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\\n\\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \\n\\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\\n\\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\\n\\nGood luck out there.\\n\\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\\n\\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIn the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\\n\\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\\n\\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\\n\\nHere’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\\n[*] Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\\n\\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\\n\\nIt ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\\n\\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \\n\\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\\n\\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \\n\\nBangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own.\\n\\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \\n\\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \\n\\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\\n\\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\\n\\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\\n\\nOther than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\\n\\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\\n\\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed Low Profile\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate).\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\\n\\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\\n\\nKings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \\n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\\n[/list]\\n\\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\\n\\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon.\\n\\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match.\\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \\n\\nItems will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\\n\\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \\n\\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\\n\\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\\n\\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls.

In “Locked and Loaded”, hit the ground with a full loadout of level 1 gear. You’ll have a Mozambique, White Shotgun Bolt, HCOG Classic Scope, White Evo Shield, White Helmet, White Backpack, White Knockdown Shield, two Syringes, two Shield Cells, and one stack of shotgun ammo. What more could you possibly need, right?\\n\\nAll Common/White level attachments and equipment will also be removed from the loot pool (outside of Common scopes) during the takeover. Drop in and knock ’em out!\\n\\n[b]Seasonal Challenges[/b]\\nTo continue the celebration, we’re giving you some fun challenges to go after with new badges to earn.\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-collection-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Get the “Daily Discovery” Nessie Badge by completing 75 Daily Challenges\\n[*] “Respect your elders” and earn the Mozambique Badge by dealing 102,816 Damage (get the reference?)\\n[*] Earn “Time to Win and Stay Alive” with 8 different Legends to get the Smolfinder Badge\\n[/list]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-mozambique.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nAlso, snag the “Mozambique Here” Weapon Charm by dealing 3,333 Damage with everyone’s favorite weapon to ping, the Mozambique. The Locked and Loaded takeover may help with this one.\\n\\n[b]Anniversary Collection Event[/b]\\nWe’re bringing back 24 fan-favorite items and giving them a fresh look with crimson red and gold touches. If you’ve missed out on a skin you really wanted in the past, now’s the time to snag it, but with a new look that lets others know you were here in the early days of Apex Legends. \\n\\nNormally, unlocking all the items in a Collection Event unlocks a specific heirloom. But you only turn two once, so we’re mixing it up a little bit. Unlocking all items in the Collection Event will earn you 150 heirloom shards, so you can unlock any heirloom you want. And to make it a little bit easier to get there, for this one time only, the crafting cost for all items in the Collection Event has been reduced by 50%. \\n\\nFor collectors looking to get the most bang for your buck, check out our Anniversary event bundles featuring the new content.\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2021/02/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-event-badges.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOne last minor detail: If you earn Event Packs from the Reward Track after you’ve already unlocked everything in the Collection Event, those packs are still good. They’ll simply grant you 700 Apex Coins (their purchase cost).\\n\\nThat’s all for now. But before we go, we want to say, again, thank you. The last two years has been incredible, and it’s all thanks to the community that has formed around this game. Here’s to two years, and to the future—the best is yet to come!\\n\\nSee you in the Arena.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': \"Hey everyone, I’m Chad Grenier, the game director of Apex Legends. \\n\\nI’ve been at Respawn since the studio’s formation in 2010 and have had the privilege to work on many great games, including Apex Legends from the very beginning. \\n\\nIn just a few days we will be celebrating our two year anniversary so we’ve been doing some reflecting and reminiscing on how we’ve gotten to where we are today. I’d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story.\\n\\n\\n[b]ORIGIN STORY & LAUNCH[/b]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-origin-story.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\n\\nAfter shipping Titanfall 2 we were hard at work on post-release Titanfall content and naturally starting to explore ideas for another game. Apex Legends wasn’t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game.\\n\\nAlmost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called ‘Survival’ where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]Early ‘survival’ game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together[/i]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\nOur prototype map called ‘real big map’ was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely\\n\\nFast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\\\\\n[i]The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones[/i]\\n\\nThe gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn’t stop playing!\\n\\nThere was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of ‘Friday Night Fights’ playtest winners[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe name of the game turned from “Survival” to “Apex Predator”. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system.\\n\\n\\nIt became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called “Apex Legends” and would never look back.\\n\\nOf course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn’t mean the world will love what you’ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. \\n\\nKnowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it.\\n\\nA few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn’t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement!\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch.\\n\\nI remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team “Don’t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!”\\n\\nAs the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games!\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nEight hours later while we’re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap!\\n\\nThree days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players.\\n\\n[b]TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE[/b]\\n\\nSince launch we’ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We’ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game.\\n\\nThe game continues to grow. Next month, we’ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we’ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWe’ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it’s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game.\\n\\nFor us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It’s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It’s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity.\\n\\nWe’ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We’ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives.\\n\\nIt’s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. \\n\\nThank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come.\\n\\n– Chad\\n\",\n",

       "  'contents': 'The latest season of Apex Legends introduces our most explosive Legend yet, a hard-hitting new gun, a world-shattering update to Kings Canyon, and a whole new batch of quality-of-life updates.\\n\\nSeason 8: Mayhem brings the boom starting February 2nd at 10am PT.\\n\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n\\n\\n[b]DEVSTREAM[/b]\\nJoin the designers as they break down the most explosive updates coming in Season 8.\\n[previewyoutube=BeeCa18YK9M;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n[b]MEET FUSE[/b]\\n[previewyoutube=OAWsJ-m1dV0;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nMeet Fuse: a mercenary-turned-cage fighter who never turns down a good dust-up. His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it’s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses “Wally” to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames.\\n\\n[b]Passive - Grenadier[/b]\\n\\nStack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately.\\n\\n[b]Tactical - Knuckle Cluster[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. \\n\\n[b]Ultimate - The Motherlode[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=Z-xDoDSDM2Y;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[b]NEW WEAPON: 30-30 REPEATER[/b]\\nThis heavy ammo lever-action repeater boasts hard-hitting rounds that’ll nail a fleeing Mirage at 200 paces.\\n\\nThe 30-30 is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the Apex Games.\\n\\nDISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER\\nThe 30-30 Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can’t quite capture.\\n\\nTo further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the 30-30 Repeater has a built-in charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short build-up.\\n\\nThe 30-30 reloads one round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won’t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff.\\n\\nThe 30-30’s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with.\\n\\n\\n[b]KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE[/b]\\nSeason 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper’s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-8-map-updates]here.\\n\\n[/url]\\n\\n\\n[b]LEGENDARY MAGAZINES[/b]\\nSeason 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons.\\n\\n\\n[b]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/b]\\nDamage counter\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] We have now added a damage counter to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we’re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges!\\n[*] Pinging Ammo\\n[*] Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with \"player wants ammo\" in quick chat.\\n[*] Color Blind update\\n[*] Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled\\n[*] Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins\\n[*] Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character\\'s backstory, we\\'ve added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend\\'s life.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]LEGEND META[/b]\\nWraith: Hitbox adjustments.\\nDev Note:\\nWe know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith.\\n\\nWraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we’re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas.\\n\\n\\nEven with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future.\\n\\n[b]Rampart:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Sheila angle increase from 120° to 180°\\n[*] Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through)\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nRampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We’re keeping a careful eye on this one.\\n\\n[b]Horizon:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears.\\n[/list]\\nDev Note:\\nHorizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect.\\n\\n[b]Octane:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane’s “super-jump” that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump).\\n[*] From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they’ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Crypto:[/b]\\n\\nRemove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones.\\n\\n\\n[b]Loba:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Caustic:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic’s team is eliminated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Mirage:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Mirage decoys create footstep sounds.\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nThis change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won’t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.\\n\\n[b]WEAPON META[/b]\\n\\n\\n[b]Fully Kitted Rotation[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\\n[*] Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Attachments[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool \\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Hop Ups[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool\\n[*] The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Volt[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Alternator[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Spitfire[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19\\n[*] Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2\\n[*] Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]EVA 8[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]BUG FIXES[/b]\\n\\n[b]Caustic[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic’s highlight vision.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Loba[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Rampart[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Jumpads in Octane’s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them.\\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart\\'s passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]\\nHavoc[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart’s Amped Cover.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon’s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Clubs[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match\\n[*] Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message\\n[*] Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]MISC[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder’s Town takeover.\\n[*] Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop.\\n[*] Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus.\\n[/list]\\n\\n',\n",

Breathe it in at the all-new Caustic Treatment; a new dominant mousetrap with lots of high quality loot that beckons all Legends who seek the glorious cheese.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-caustic-takeover.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWhere Water Treatment once stood, the new Caustic Treatment was constructed to prevent the Crash Site fuel spill from reaching the ocean. Or was it? \\n\\nForever the scientist, Caustic has set out an experiment that requires “test subjects” to drain the toxic liquid from the center of the facility. Doing this temporarily grants access to four gold loot items locked in cages. Players must be quick though, as greed can be deadly.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-chambers.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIf you happen to notice that the Mirage Voyage is missing, you can put the blame on Caustic. The polluted fumes from Caustic Treatment really killed the vibe, so Mirage set sail to take the party elsewhere. No one’s spotted it yet, but that party boat tends to show up in an arena when you least expect it.\\n\\n[h2]RING FURY ESCALATION TAKEOVER, HEAT SHIELDS, AND THE SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\nRing Fury is a new Apex playlist takeover that follows regular BR rules, but each round, one or more Ring Flares will appear on the map within the current ring. Ring Flares are slowly expanding pockets of the Ring within the Arena! Maggie sure does know how to start a party. \\n\\nThose who get caught in a Ring Flare will take damage equal to the damage dealt by the current round’s Ring. You’ll be given a short warning on the map and minimap before the Ring Flare appears. Legends will call out if they are in direct danger or if there’s one opening up nearby.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-18-ringfury-ring-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nSo how do you deal with Ring Flares? Well, two ways. First, try not to get caught in them, silly. Failing that, you can drop a new item we’re introducing called Heat Shields. \\n\\n[h2]HEAT SHIELDS[/h2]\\n\\nDuring the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover, all players will start with a Heat Shield in their inventory on drop. Throw down your Heat Shield to avoid damage from Ring Flares (or from the ring itself!) and remember that you can always find more. The loot pool for this event has been tuned to spread Heat Shields out throughout the map.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/videos/apex-legends-screenshot-season8-chaostheory-20-heatshield-clean.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nHeat Shields cast a protective dome, pouring the deadly effect of the ring over the barrier for a short time, enabling Legends to loot, revive and generally make some amazing plays outside of the Ring. Plus, when you’re inside the dome, the use of healing items is sped up by 50% and the speed of Revives is increased by 25%. This bonus is ONLY given by Heat Shields that have been activated by the ring. Heat Shields on standby in the safe zone are conserving energy, and don't grant this bonus.\\n\\nBut watch out: The Heat Shield will slowly degrade in power as it’s damaged by the ring. The damage of the Ring is reflected in the duration of the Heat Shield, so don’t expect it to last very long in the final rounds.\\n\\nAfter the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover concludes, the Heat Shield will remain in the game as general ground loot.\\n\\n[h2]SURVIVAL SLOT[/h2]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-survival-slot.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the Heat Shield doesn't take up any of your normal inventory slots—instead, it resides in the brand new “Survival Slot”. \\n\\nThe Survival Slot aims to eliminate the choice between normal loot and situational utilities like a Mobile Respawn Beacon or a Heat Shield. Now, there’s no reason not to carry one of these around. Coordinate with your team, and the possibility for more survivability tactics soars!\\n\\nLike the heat shield, the Survival Slot itself will continue to be available in the game even after the Ring Fury Escalation Takeover ends. \\n\\n[h2]INTRODUCING ESCALATION TAKEOVERS[/h2]\\n\\nLike previous playlist takeovers, Ring Fury will replace regular Duos and Trios playlists for the two-week duration of the Collection Event. Ranked will not be affected.\\n\\nHowever, unlike previous takeovers, Ring Fury is an “Escalation Takeover,” which means that every few days during the event, we’re going to turn some knobs to crank up the prevalence, timing, and size of Ring Flares. By the end of the event, you can expect five different stages of escalation. Exciting!\\n\\nGood luck out there.\\n\\n[h2]NO-FILL MATCHMAKING[/h2]\\n\\nTL;DR: No-Fill Matchmaking is a new way to play the game as a solo Legend. Here’s how it works, and why you might choose to use it.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-crossplay.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nIn the lobby, you’ll now see a checkbox entitled “Fill Matchmaking”. This means the matchmaking system will attempt to fill your squad to Duos or Trios, whichever you queued for. This is how the game has worked up to this point, and will be the default setting after every match you play.\\n\\nUnchecking this box and clicking Play will send your party into your selected playlist without filling your team with other players. So, if you solo queue into Trios, with “Fill Matchmaking” unchecked, you’ll go in alone. You’ll be on a team of one, against teams of three.\\n\\nWe still strongly believe that, at its best, Apex Legends is a game about teamplay. But we’re launching this No-Fill matchmaking as an option for solo players because we think it gives a lot of creative opportunities for you to play the game your way.\\n\\nHere’s some things you might want to use No-Fill Matchmaking for:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Focus on completing certain Daily and Weekly challenges\\n[*] Warm up, drop hot, and get into lots of fights\\n[*] Challenge yourself—can you win a round of Duos alone? How about Trios?\\n[*] Experience the latest lore teaser on your own\\n[*] Explore the map and experiment with characters you haven’t tried before; Take an opportunity to learn a bit more about the game at your own pace.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWe have some limitations in place for No-Fill matchmaking, because we don’t want it to greatly disrupt the experience or pacing of the game for other players. We only allow six potential No-Fill players in any match, and the feature isn’t available in Ranked.\\n\\nGive it a shot and let us know what you think.\\n\\n[h2]CHAOS THEORY COLLECTION EVENT AND REWARDS TRACK[/h2]\\n\\nIt ain’t a Collection Event without new unlockables. Let’s start with the freebies. As usual, the Chaos Theory Collection Event brings a rewards track with all-new earnable cosmetics, this time including legendary Kraber and EVA-8 weapon skins among the goodies.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-prize-track.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nYou can earn 1,000 points per day and challenges refresh daily. There are also stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if you complete them during the event. All of these challenges also stack with your Battle Pass, so you can complete multiple at once.\\n\\nAnd of course, Chaos Theory also introduces a brand new set of 24 themed, event-limited cosmetics. \\n\\nInspired by the warriors of the Frontier, our Legends are donning fierce new looks as they drop into the arena.\\n\\nAll 24 items will be available through direct purchase (for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals) and in Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. If you collect all 24 event items, you’ll unlock the Bangalore Heirloom set. \\n\\nBangalore took this Pilot’s knife off a cold-blooded opponent. Since that day, she’s made it her own.\\n\\nAfter the event ends, the Bangalore Heirloom will become available via heirloom crafting. \\n\\nA few more nitty gritty details on how this Collection Event will work: \\n\\nFirst, the crafting costs for the skins are returning to their regular pricing now that the Anniversary Collection Event has ended.\\n\\nSecond, each Event Pack will come with one event item and two non-event items at the following drop rates:\\n\\n[img] https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/images/2020/09/apex-inline-image-probability-aftermarket-event.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg [/img]\\n\\nOther than that, it’s not too complicated! If you want to learn more about how Event-Limited Cosmetics work, visit our [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions]FAQ[/url].\\n\\n[h2]LEGEND UPDATES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Nox Gas Grenade cooldown increased from 2.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes.\\n[*] Nox Gas damages at a flat rate of 5hp per tick instead of ramping up from 6hp → 12hp.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev note:[/h3] Caustic is brutally effective at slowing down engagements. The entirety of his kit revolves around gas with a large area of effect, slow, vision obstruction, and direct health damage. It’s proven to be too oppressive in too many scenarios especially considering teammates can play in gas relatively unimpaired. Significantly reducing gas damage (without taking it away completely or having it affect armor instead) seems like a fair compromise that stays true to the character while making him less oppressive on the receiving end. We will be monitoring the data and gameplay closely. If these changes hit Caustic’s appeal or effectiveness too hard we will revisit accordingly.\\n\\n[h2]Pathfinder[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed Low Profile\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Dev Note:[/h2] Low Profile has been used as a balancing tool for both mobile and/or small legends. Although Path is still mobile, his hitbox is large. While his overall win rate and encounter win rate is by no means low, it’s hard to justify keeping Low Profile on a hitbox of his size.\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed 15% faster heal item usage while in Dome of Protection.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased Black Hole cooldown from 2 minutes to 3 minutes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Revenant[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Revenant’s Silence now disables Mirage’s cloaked revive & respawn as well as Octane’s Swift Mend.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wattson[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wattson now has passive shield regen at 0.5 hp/s (half of Octane’s current health regen rate).\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Explosives damage Amped Cover normally, instead of inflicting 200 damage.\\n[*] Explosives damage Sheila normally, instead of inflicting 175 damage.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]Walls should be beefy and powerful once built. Before Rampart shipped, we were worried that her nests would be too oppressive and so we gave enemy players the option to quickly clear them out with grenades. This wasn't necessary, as it turns out, so we're removing increased damage from grenades against Amped Cover and Sheila.\\n\\n[h2]WEAPON UPDATE[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Weapon Optics[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] All gold AR and LMG default optics updated to 2x Bruiser.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Pellet damage decreased from 13 → 11. Fire rate increased from 1.0 → 1.1.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The goal of these changes are to place this weapon’s identity between the fast fire EVA-8 and the heavy hitting Peacekeeper. The Mastiff has consistently been dominant in close quarters combat given its forgiving spread pattern and high damage spikes with each shot. This change reduces that high damage potential in order to limit the amount of two pumps players experience on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]Wingman[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*]  +1 bullet to every magazine size, including base.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Hemlok[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Increased hip-fire spread.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h3]Dev Note: [/h3]The burst damage from the Hemlok's hip-fire was feeling a little too consistent for an AR that should excel at medium range. This change mitigates the Hemlok’s close quarters damage spikes that felt bad on the receiving end.\\n\\n[h2]QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES[/h2]\\n\\nKings Canyon Loot - we’ve done a pass on the loot to bring up the quality across the map, while also maintaining a certain amount of loot after Mirage Voyage has flown away. \\n\\n[list]\\n[*] The wooden shacks across the map should have a few more pieces each, and generally be a little higher quality. \\n[*] Spotted Lake has been reduced to Medium Quality from High.\\n[*] Crash Site has redistributed the loot in the area slightly. The amount stays the same, but the higher quality loot should be in the ship.\\n[*] Caustic Treatment has more loot than Water Treatment, and it remains Hiqh Quality.\\n[/list]\\n\\nLocked Weapon Optic Swapping - For guns with fully locked attachment slots, like fully-kitted gold weapons and most crate weapons, you can now remove the optic and replace it with a different sight.  This does not apply to the Kraber sniper rifle.\\n\\nAssists have been added to the in-game HUD, next to kills. This was already present in Ranked and now has been added to unranked. Assists still don’t contribute to XP. This has replaced the Spectator “eye” icon.\\n\\nAssists and Knocks have been added to your squad’s banners and will show at the end of a match.\\nClub names now appear on Match Summary and Champion screen if all players are part of the same club. \\n\\nItems will no longer “stick” to Crafting Replicator when dropped on the Replicator.\\n\\nBadge Progress - for badges that have longer amounts of progress, hovering over the badge will show you more information. For example, if you’re trying to get 50 wins as Lifeline, you’ll now see that you have 45 instead of somewhere between 15 and 50.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/chaos-theory-collection-event/apex-blog-image-chaos-theory-badge-progress.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nPing My Deathbox - While respawning on a dropship, you can now ping your own deathbox to help locate it easier. \\n\\nGold Backpack - Players being revived by a gold backpack will have a crackle of energy—based on the tier of armor they wear—while the revive is taking place. They will also display the armor heal FX when the revive is finished. This change should help players prioritize pushing a revive in progress.\\n\\nPlayers on PC can now go back to the title screen from the lobby to allow switching of data centers without restarting the game.\\n\\nAdded numbers to the Advanced Look Controls. This should help people experiment and easily revert back to their favorite settings.\\n\\nWhen scanning a beacon for Ring 6, you should now be able to see the location where Ring 6 finishes.\\n\\nInspect Weapon - Since the Survival Slot took its button on controller (we only have so many buttons!), Inspect Weapon has been moved to the emote wheel by default. It can be bound to any key on PC.\\n\\n[h2]BUG FIXES[/h2]\\n\\n[h2]Gibraltar[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Corrected an issue with Gibraltar not getting hit registrations when simultaneously releasing ADS and shooting while his Gun Shield was up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Wraith[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Wraith players can no longer cancel Into the Void by jumping at a wall\\n[*] The New Skydive Emote will now work with Legendary Skins\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Caustic[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug that was causing Nox Gas to flicker for some players affected by it\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Octane[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Repeatedly using the same jump pad no longer disables double-jumps\\n[*] Players are no longer allowed to “glide” along a wall after using the jump pad\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Crypto[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Crypto’s animation to bring out his Drone is no longer skippable by throwing a holospray\\n[*] Crypto can no longer teleport to a replicator\\n[*] Reloading the Mastiff and 30-30 will no longer be faster while in Crypto’s drone\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Loba[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few areas Loba could teleport into that would get her stuck\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Rampart[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Players can no longer use Sheila to get under the world when placed too close to the Phase Runner in Olympus\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Horizon[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed the Gravity Lift falling through the floor when used on the train tracks in World’s Edge’s Sorting Factory\\n[*] Using a zipline after a Gravity Lift will no longer increase accuracy\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Fuse[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Motherload will now damage and destroy jump pads\\n[*] When under a small enclosure, players will no longer be pushed out after using Motherload\\n[*] Players can no longer double their grenades after looting a dead Fuse’s deathbox\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]Mastiff[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the Mastiff will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]3030 Repeater[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Dropping and picking up the 30-30 will no longer cause it to be reloaded\\n[*] 30-30 will now have spread deviation when ADS firing and jumping\\n[*] \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h2]MISC[/h2]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing Steam users from sending friend requests to each other\\n[*] Usernames now update when a user swaps between the Origin Client to the Steam Client\\n[*] Fixed a bug preventing players from creating or joining clubs due to their EA Account already being associated with another platform\\n[/list]\\n\\nThat’s all for now.

But you only turn two once, so we’re mixing it up a little bit. Unlocking all items in the Collection Event will earn you 150 heirloom shards, so you can unlock any heirloom you want.

Apex Legends wasn’t even a thought yet. We were discussing and trying new ideas, playtesting prototype campaign ideas, playing new game modes, and two designers started a small prototype that would change the course of our game.\\n\\nAlmost two years before the release of Apex Legends, we had our first company-wide playtest on a new game mode called ‘Survival’ where pilots and Titans would fight it out to be the last man standing, battle royale style.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-survival-mode.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]Early ‘survival’ game mode put 24 pilots into a drop ship where they would form teams of 3 by running to and entering the same droppod together[/i]\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-real-big-map.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\nOur prototype map called ‘real big map’ was quite different than Kings Canyon in that it was more sparse and allowed for Titans to roam freely\\n\\nFast forward another month, and the team working on this new game mode had grown to over 20 people. In October of 2017 we saw the first versions of Gibraltar, Bloodhound, and Wraith in game, in November of 2017 we did our first 50 player game successfully and had just begun playtesting on a map that would eventually be called Kings Canyon.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-featured-image-two-year-anniversary.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\\\\\n[i]The earliest recognizable image of Kings Canyon. Before town names they were simply called zones[/i]\\n\\nThe gameplay improved over time, with Titans and wallrunning being removed to slow down the pace of the game and bring more balance to the gameplay. Of course, we tried to keep Titans in the game for many months, but once we accepted that we were making something fundamentally different from Titanfall, we entered a new phase. Company playtests were happening weekly, and often running late into the night. We couldn’t stop playing!\\n\\nThere was a leaderboard on the chalkboard in the kitchen showing who had the most wins. The company had become consumed with playing this new mode we were building.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-chalk-board.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[i]A chalkboard in the studio keeps track of ‘Friday Night Fights’ playtest winners[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe name of the game turned from “Survival” to “Apex Predator”. Kings Canyon became more like Kings Canyon we know today. We began prototyping new mechanics like respawning teammates and legend abilities. We would force the entire team to playtest without headsets, and with player names turned off, so we could build a best in class in-game communication system.\\n\\n\\nIt became clear to us that we had something great on our hands, and our plans for the other project were scrapped. We were then all-hands on what would eventually be called “Apex Legends” and would never look back.\\n\\nOf course, thinking you have a great game on your hands doesn’t mean the world will love what you’ve created so we were all very anxious to see how our game did at launch. \\n\\nKnowing that many of our fans would be expecting another traditional Titanfall game, we opted to go with a secret launch so players could immediately play the game when they first heard about it. We knew players would love the game if they could just play it.\\n\\nA few days before launch we held a private event in Los Angeles to show the game to top streamers, content creators, and media. After a presentation they got to play the game for two hours. Two hours turned into eight, and they didn’t want to put it down. The team was starting to become overwhelmed with excitement!\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-viewing.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-launch-playtest.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nOn Feb 4th, 2019 we would launch our game to the world's surprise. We hoped some players would download the game and love it, but also knew that creating a free-to-play game was more about longevity and building over time, as opposed to a blockbuster boxed game launch.\\n\\nI remember one of our live ops engineers (responsible for ensuring our servers work at scale) setting expectations and telling the team “Don’t expect a million players right out of the gate, or even within the first few months!”\\n\\nAs the entire team stood in the kitchen staring at our projector screen we counted down together the seconds until the game launched. By the time the champagne toasts and cheers had settled down we already had tens of thousands of players in games!\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-1-million.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nEight hours later while we’re still at work we hit a million players. We of course had to go give that live ops engineer some crap!\\n\\nThree days later, we stood in the same kitchen and counted down to 10 million players, and then 24 days after launch hit 50 million players.\\n\\n[b]TOWARD AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE[/b]\\n\\nSince launch we’ve had eight season launches, over a dozen lore events paired with original video content and over a dozen major in-game events. We’ve added two new maps, vehicles, eight new legends, and countless other limited-time game modes and improvements to the game.\\n\\nThe game continues to grow. Next month, we’ll launch on Nintendo Switch. Work on a mobile version of Apex Legends is well underway. And later this year, we’ll launch new ways to play the game that take us beyond battle royale.\\n\\n[img]https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/articles/two-years-of-apex-legends/apex-blog-image-two-year-anniversary-fuse-switch.jpg.adapt.1456w.jpg[/img]\\n\\nWe’ve learned how to run a successful live service game, how important player sentiment is, and how it’s entirely possible to captivate users with storytelling in a multiplayer game.\\n\\nFor us, Apex Legends is more than a game. It brings people together, it unifies players, it entertains, it takes our minds off of the real world, even if just for 30 minutes a day. It’s an avenue for artists, writers, streamers, and content creators to express themselves. It’s also a game that takes a stance on the importance of diversity.\\n\\nWe’ve heard stories from players all over the world about how our game has kept friends and family members connected during the pandemic and how some of our innovations, such as the ping system, have made multiplayer gaming more accessible. We’ve even heard heartfelt stories from our fans about how Apex helped save their lives.\\n\\nIt’s you, the players, that motivate us to create games, it always has been. \\n\\nThank you for playing, Legends. Your support and love over the last two years have been an overwhelmingly positive driving force as we continue to make Apex all it can be. We hope you enjoy the launch of Season 8: Mayhem, and all the rest to come.\\n\\n– Chad\\n\",\n",

       "  'contents': 'The latest season of Apex Legends introduces our most explosive Legend yet, a hard-hitting new gun, a world-shattering update to Kings Canyon, and a whole new batch of quality-of-life updates.\\n\\nSeason 8: Mayhem brings the boom starting February 2nd at 10am PT.\\n\\nRead on for details.\\n\\n\\n\\n[b]DEVSTREAM[/b]\\nJoin the designers as they break down the most explosive updates coming in Season 8.\\n[previewyoutube=BeeCa18YK9M;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n[b]MEET FUSE[/b]\\n[previewyoutube=OAWsJ-m1dV0;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\nMeet Fuse: a mercenary-turned-cage fighter who never turns down a good dust-up. His affinity for explosions allows him to carry extra grenades and to throw them faster and further. He can launch a cluster bomb with airburst explosives. And when it’s time to really bring the boom, Fuse uses “Wally” to launch a bombardment that encircles an area in a ring of flames.\\n\\n[b]Passive - Grenadier[/b]\\n\\nStack an extra grenade per inventory slot. Fire grenades farther, faster, and more accurately.\\n\\n[b]Tactical - Knuckle Cluster[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a cluster bomb that continuously expels airburst explosives on impact. \\n\\n[b]Ultimate - The Motherlode[/b]\\n\\nLaunch a bombardment that encircles a target area in a wall of flames.\\n\\n[previewyoutube=Z-xDoDSDM2Y;full][/previewyoutube]\\n\\n\\n[b]NEW WEAPON: 30-30 REPEATER[/b]\\nThis heavy ammo lever-action repeater boasts hard-hitting rounds that’ll nail a fleeing Mirage at 200 paces.\\n\\nThe 30-30 is the benchmark for reliability, designed to withstand whipping sandstorms and temporal instability, which made it an obvious choice for the Apex Games.\\n\\nDISCIPLINED TRIGGER FINGER\\nThe 30-30 Repeater requires the user to rechamber their rounds between shots which brings a methodic rhythm to the rifle, an analogue elegance that the modern weapons of the Outlands just can’t quite capture.\\n\\nTo further tempt those itchy trigger fingers, the 30-30 Repeater has a built-in charge giving players an opportunity to deal increased damage with each shot at the cost of a short build-up.\\n\\nThe 30-30 reloads one round at a time, which makes for some very interesting resource management you won’t find anywhere else, even on the Mastiff.\\n\\nThe 30-30’s engagement range allows unique opportunities to reload individual rounds between shots. This gives the Repeater the ability to lay down consistent precision ranged pressure, something weapons with full reloads can sometimes struggle with.\\n\\n\\n[b]KINGS CANYON MAP UPDATE[/b]\\nSeason 8 once again sees changes to Kings Canyon. The main new point of interest shows the devastation from the ship crashing into the map. Players can now explore beyond Artillery, Spotted Lakes takes over the Slums and some new observation towers for basic recon or a sniper’s nest. Read more on the map changes in the map blog [url=https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-8-map-updates]here.\\n\\n[/url]\\n\\n\\n[b]LEGENDARY MAGAZINES[/b]\\nSeason 8 introduces the Gold-tier magazines. Attaching it to a weapon automatically reloads your stowed weapons after a brief delay. The Gold magazine has the same capacity as Purple mags, and is available for Light, Heavy, Snipers, and Energy Weapons.\\n\\n\\n[b]QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATES[/b]\\nDamage counter\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] We have now added a damage counter to the HUD. This was a highly requested feature, so we’re excited to allow people easier tracking for chasing those badges and challenges!\\n[*] Pinging Ammo\\n[*] Pinging weapons or ammo in your inventory displays your current ammo count along with \"player wants ammo\" in quick chat.\\n[*] Color Blind update\\n[*] Healing and reviving will now follow colorblind rules when colorblind settings are enabled\\n[*] Lore Blurbs on Canon Skins\\n[*] Some of our skins are canon, and some are just for fun. For the skins that represent an important part of that character\\'s backstory, we\\'ve added a small blurb to describe the significance of that skin in the Legend\\'s life.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]LEGEND META[/b]\\nWraith: Hitbox adjustments.\\nDev Note:\\nWe know Wraith will always be a popular pick considering the amount of combat utility in her kit. After many tweaks to her abilities and animations, the fact remains that her win rate continues to be at the very top as it has since day one. With Season 7 hitbox adjustments to Pathfinder, we were able to control his power without nerfing his kit. We hope to do the same with Wraith.\\n\\nWraith now has a slightly larger hitbox than her fellow small legends, but the changes stay true to her model. As you can see in the before and after comparison, we’re adding some width mostly in the torso and leg areas.\\n\\n\\nEven with these changes, Wraith remains small and hard to hit. She will retain Low Profile as we monitor her usage and win rates to see if power can be given back in other ways in the future.\\n\\n[b]Rampart:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Sheila angle increase from 120° to 180°\\n[*] Wall health in build phase increased from 1hp to 45hp (sniper rounds still pierce through)\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nRampart has remained at the bottom across our performance metrics since her release. Her kit is very much built around proactively setting up a powerful position, but in a game as fast-moving as Apex, we determined her walls should have some reactive power as well. We’re keeping a careful eye on this one.\\n\\n[b]Horizon:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Gravity Lift effective cooldown increased from 21s to 25s. The 15s cooldown timer will now start when the Gravity Lift disappears.\\n[/list]\\nDev Note:\\nHorizon released strong, to the point where she rivals Wraith in win rate and pick rate. For the time being, we are monitoring her usage and checking whether or not the cooldown changes have a significant effect.\\n\\n[b]Octane:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Launch Pad Remastered: Many players may have known about Octane’s “super-jump” that was possible with a well-timed jump while hitting the pad. Once the double-jump option was introduced, there was an input clash that led to unreliable usage. We decided to add some launch options that are better defined than the old super-jump.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Hitting the jump pad from a standing position will launch players along a high arc (the speed and trajectory of the old super-jump).\\n[*] From a crouched position, players will launch along a low arc, meaning they’ll fly lower but farther in the horizontal direction.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Crypto:[/b]\\n\\nRemove ability to stick arc stars to friendly drones.\\n\\n\\n[b]Loba:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot inside unopened care packages is now visible with Eye for Quality and accessible through the Black Market Boutique.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Caustic:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] All gas now dissipates as soon as Caustic’s team is eliminated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Mirage:[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Mirage decoys create footstep sounds.\\n[/list]\\n\\nDev Note:\\nThis change was mistakenly mentioned in the Fight Night patch notes when it was in fact coming with this patch. Mirage decoys will now have footstep audio in a limited capacity. There won’t be a footstep tornado if an enemy Mirage ults nearby, but it should be slightly harder to pick out the real Mirage from audio cues alone.\\n\\n[b]WEAPON META[/b]\\n\\n\\n[b]Fully Kitted Rotation[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Removed: Wingman, Sentinel, Havoc, G7, Alternator\\n[*] Added: R-301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, Spitfire\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Attachments[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] We are removing the Gold Barrel from the loot pool \\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Hop Ups[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The Double Tap hop up will be removed from the loot pool\\n[*] The Anvil Rounds hop up will be added into the loot pool\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Volt[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage decreased from 16 to 15\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Alternator[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 15 to 16\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[b]Spitfire[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Bullet damage increased from 18 to 19\\n[*] Reload speed increased from 2.8 seconds to 3.2\\n[*] Empty Reload speed increased from 3.33 seconds to 3.8\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]EVA 8[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fire rate increased from 2.0 to 2.1\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]BUG FIXES[/b]\\n\\n[b]Caustic[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Sonar abilities no longer stop Caustic’s highlight vision.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Loba[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a few exploitable areas on Kings Canyon that Loba was able to reach via her Bracelet.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Rampart[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Jumpads in Octane’s town takeover no longer allow Rampart to place Sheila on them.\\n[*] Fixed an issue with Rampart\\'s passive persisting even after changing characters in Firing Range\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]\\nHavoc[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing the Havoc to have 100% accuracy when hip-fired through Rampart’s Amped Cover.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Peacekeeper[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed a POV issue that occurred when using Horizon’s abilities, then immediately going into ADS with a Peacekeeper.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Clubs[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Re-enabled ability to invite friends to club from friends list\\n[*] Fixed an issue causing some users who have opted out of \"Last Squad Invites\" to not appear in club event timelines when placing in the top 5 of a match\\n[*] Failing to connect to the club database no longer leads to a misleading \"Kicked from club\" message\\n[*] Players will no longer be kicked from clubs when switching to another profile on Xbox.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]MISC[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n[*] Fixed an issue with crowds not cheering in Pathfinder’s Town takeover.\\n[*] Fixed an issue preventing some heirlooms from appearing in the heirloom shop.\\n[*] Fixed an issue that allowed Thermites to deal damage through certain walls on Olympus.\\n[/list]\\n\\n',\n",
